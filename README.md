 # Binary Search Program

This repository contains an implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python. The code performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element. The program returns the index of the target element if it is found, or `-1` if the element is not present in the array.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the binary search algorithm, which is an efficient search method for sorted arrays.
Further code explanation is given the program with each code line.

### How to Run the Program
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x should be installed on your machine.

### Steps to Run

1.Directly copy the code from this folder and run on Anaconda Navigator
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine

#### Time Complexity 
The time complexity of binay search program is O(log n) in average and best cases where n is the size of array
(Worst Case O(n))
Binary search runs O(n) in many cases such that the array is unsorted and very large, binary case not have a time complexity of O(n) in worst case as it is optimized for sorted arrays.The O(n) complexity will only apply when you are searching through unsorted array.
